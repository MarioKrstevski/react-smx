By installing NodeJS we get

node
npm - node package manager (add/remove .js files(modules/libraries/packages))
npx - executor (executes a commands)

We type the commands in terminal - Terminal - New Terminal (zsh,bash,cmd)

npx create-react-app [project-name]
- generates a lot of files to create enviroment for development

package.json (file that holds all imporant information about the project)
- it is used to recreate the project

node_modules - a lot of .js files that do their own specific thing which we use


We publish the project on github

git push - upload
git pull - download
